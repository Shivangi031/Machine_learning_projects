# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-
I'm excited to share a project I've been working on- Speech Emotion Recognition, where we explore how machines can detect emotions based on audio input. This project uses the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS) dataset, aiming to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more from speech samples.
